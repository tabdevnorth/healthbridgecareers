    <h2 class="h1" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">About the Founder</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    HealthBridge Careers was founded by a healthcare leader with 
    <span class="emphasized-text">director-level and program-level leadership experience</span> across frontline nursing, hospital operations, accreditation, quality and system improvement initiatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN) and an MBA</strong>, I bring a dual perspective — understanding both the clinical realities of healthcare delivery and the operational, leadership and hiring expectations within hospital and health system environments.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Throughout my career, I have:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; margin-bottom: 24px;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;">
      <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: var(--accent1);">•</span>
      <strong>Interviewed and hired</strong> across nursing, leadership, administrative and allied health roles
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;">
      <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: var(--accent1);">•</span>
      <strong>Designed interview guides</strong> and structured selection processes at the program level
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;">
      <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: var(--accent1);">•</span>
      <strong>Led and supported teams</strong> through operational, quality and accreditation initiatives
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;">
      <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: var(--accent1);">•</span>
      <strong>Coached healthcare professionals</strong> through career transitions — many of whom successfully secured roles they were working toward
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I understand <span class="emphasized-text">how resumes are screened, how interviews are evaluated, and how leadership potential is assessed</span> — because I have been part of those processes from the hiring side.
  </p>

  <p>
    HealthBridge Careers was created to offer healthcare professionals <strong>informed, honest and strategic career guidance</strong> — grounded in real experience within Ontario's healthcare system.
